# CSC175-Labs
These are some of my assignments from CSC-175 (Introduction to Algorithms). These labs showcase my improvement in programming, as well as showcase my ability to break down problems. 

### Course Rationale (From Syllabus)
This course introduces algorithmic thinking and program development by having students’ produce well-structured solutions using basic problem-solving approaches. As the first course in the computer science (CS) program, this
course lays a foundation of fundamental programming and algorithmic concepts, along with a structured problem-solving approach, that will be useful to students’ regardless of their major.

### Program Learning Goals
1. Apply software design principles to create and evaluate software solutions
2. Create properly tested software using modern programming languages that solve tasks according to given specifications
3. Create computational solutions that are based on good analysis of the business and the system
4. Create computational solutions with sound project planning and management

#### Final Course Grade: A-
